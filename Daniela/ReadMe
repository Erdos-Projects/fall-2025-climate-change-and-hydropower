- Target distribution + log distribution
- Group comparisons (mode, regions)
- Seasonality (month), interannual trend (year)
- Spatial quicklook (lon/lat colored by MWh)
- Correlation heatmap (numeric)
- Static-feature vs target log–log relationships
- Climate-feature vs target relationships (sampled)
- Spearman correlations ranked by association with target
